# kanka
Thing's I've done with Kanka.

* find_campaigns.py - Super simple script I use to confirm I have basic setup (API key) working.
* Kanka_converter.py - takes the output of a kanka export and turns it into a small set of files suitable for NotebookLM. *BUT* while I haven't played with it, there is a repo I just discovered that it probably better, https://github.com/promiemotz/realmpress
